Well, just applying a back-of the envelope calculation, the first method takes 40s per volume, while the second method takes 25 seconds to combine **once** the transforms excluding motion correction, and 0.4 seconds per volume to apply the transforms including motion correction. If we plot the two with an increasing number of volumes, we can see why this quickly becomes relevant:"
